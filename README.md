# Aggregation Service for Measurement

*Note:* For an account of the changes we made to this rep and how to use it, see [NEXTROLL_CHANGES.md](NEXTROLL_CHANGES.md)

Aggregation Service provides server-side mechanism for adtechs to create summary reports. A summary
report is the result of noisy aggregation applied to a batch of aggregatable reports. Summary
reports allow for greater flexibility and a richer data model than event-level reporting,
particularly for some use-cases like conversion values. Aggregation Service operates on aggregatable
reports that are encrypted reports sent from individual user devices which contain data about
individual events in the client software, such as a Chrome browser or an Android device.

## Build and deploy

This repository contains instructions and scripts to set up and test the Aggregation Service for
[Aggregatable Reports](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md#aggregatable-reports)
locally and on Amazon Web Services
[Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/). If you want to learn more about
the [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/) Aggregation Service for the Attribution Reporting
API and other use cases, read the
[Aggregation Service proposal](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/blob/main/AGGREGATION_SERVICE_TEE.md#aggregatable-reports).
